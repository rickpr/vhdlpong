WARNING:Pack:2573 - The F7 multiplexer symbol "Koopa_V/Mmux_L_on136_SW0" and its
   I0 input driver "Koopa_V/Mram_rom_data<70>11" were implemented suboptimally
   in the same slice component. The function generator could not be placed
   directly driving the F7 multiplexer. The design will exhibit suboptimal
   timing.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
